Testing Project Submission

This project contains my work for the testing task as part of the internship application. It includes manual testing, performance testing, and Selenium automation.

Manual Testing:
  - Contains an Excel file that documents the manual testing process, including test cases, test steps, and results.
  -  Bugs Screenshots : This folder contains screenshots of the bugs encountered during manual testing.

Performance Testing:
  -  JMeter Test : This folder contains the JMeter performance test scripts used to evaluate the application's performance.
  -  Report : Includes a report detailing the results of the performance testing, including response times, throughput, and any performance issues identified.

Selenium Automation:
  - Contains Java applications written for Selenium automation testing.
  - These applications are designed to automate web interactions, validate functionality, and ensure the stability of the application under test.
  - While I have made progress on the Selenium automation scripts, I was unable to fully complete them within the timeframe for submission. 

Personal CV is also attached.

Thank you for considering my application.
